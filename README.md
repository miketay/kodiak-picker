# Kodiak Picker

The Kodiak Picker is an application written to help track and manages students, quarters/semesters (referred to as "cycles"), and classes (referred to as "tutorials").  The application allows students to choose classes to sign up for out of those available.  This can be overriden by teachers or administrators who may know better the needs of specific students.  The software can also generate reports about which students are in any class, or search by student to find out what class they are in at any given time.  Rooms and instructors are also included for each class.  Registration for new cycles can occur while an existing cycle is ongoing.
